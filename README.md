ViennaPS is a header-only C++ library for simulating microelectronic fabrication processes. It combines surface and volume representations with advanced level-set methods and Monte Carlo flux calculations, powered by high-performance ray tracing. Users can develop custom models, use pre-configured physical models, or leverage emulation for flexible and efficient process simulations.

ViennaPS is designed to be easily integrated into existing C++ projects and provides Python bindings for seamless use in Python environments. The library is under active development and is continuously improved to meet the evolving needs of process simulation in microelectronics.

> [!NOTE]  
> ViennaPS is under heavy development and improved daily. If you do have suggestions or find bugs, please let us know!

# What's New in This Branch?

This branch introduces a type of mask proximity correction, simulating the impact of electron forward and backward scattering during e-beam lithography. The previous version directly converted GDSII polygons into level sets, but this enhancement applies a Gaussian blurring effect to better reflect real-world exposure.
- **TODO: Make optical proximity correction generic to also incorporate realistic parameters for electron and photon interactions.**

## Implementation Details
### **1. Converting GDSII Polygons to a Rasterized Grid**
- The imported mask polygons are converted into a rasterized grid representation.
- The `addPolygons` function rasterizes the polygons onto a discretized grid.
- The `rasterizePolygon` function fills grid cells inside the polygon using an Even-Odd rule algorithm.
- **TODO: Allow user to configure the rasterization grid parameters (currently hardcoded).**

### **2. Applying Gaussian Blurring to Simulate Electron Scattering**
- Electron scattering effects are simulated by applying multiple separate Gaussian convolutions:
  - *Forward scattering (small sigma)*: Models short-range diffusion.
  - *Backward scattering (large sigma)*: Models long-range diffusion.
- The function `applyGaussianBlur2D` performs 2D convolution using a Gaussian kernel:
  - The kernel weights are computed based on a Gaussian distribution.
  - A normalized exposure map is generated to ensure values remain between 0 and 1.
- Method has been extended to a Multi-Gaussian model.
- **TODO: Support additional scattering models, such as exponential, Lorentzian, or Moli√®re for e-scattering.**

### **3. Combining Exposure Contributions**
- The `combineExposures` function merges forward and backward scattering contributions using a weighting factor (`backScatterFactor = 0.2`).
- The final exposure values are normalized to ensure the maximum intensity is 1.0.
- **TODO: Make the backScatterFactor a tunable parameter linked to physical scattering models.**

### **4. Extracting Contours from the Processed Exposure Grid**
- The `extractContoursAtThreshold(0.5)` function finds the contour where the exposure is equal to 0.5.
- Contours are extracted using a neighbor-based interpolation to refine the edges.
- A distance-based grouping algorithm splits contour points into separate polygons.
- **TODO: Extract the contour from the 2D exposure plane using level sets.**
  - **Convert exposure grid to a signed distance function (SDF).**
  - **Use the threshold surface as an implicit level-set or shift by threshold value for a zero level-set.**
  - **Eliminates polygon generation and splitting: a multi-polygon contour can be stored in a single level-set domain.**

### **5. Polygon Simplification and Reordering for Efficient Processing**
- Extracted contours often contain excessive detail, leading to unnecessary complexity in further processing.
- The function `simplifyPolygon` applies gradient- and distance-based filtering to remove insignificant points.
- The `simplifyPolygon` function only keeps points where:
  - The normal angle change between neighboring lines exceeds a threshold (`angleThreshold`).
  - The distance between points exceeds a specified threshold (`distanceThreshold`).
- The pruning also ensures that the resulting polygon is open-ended rather than artificially closed.
    - This is required for the GDS extrusion algorithm.
- The ordering of the polygon is optimized to ensuire compatibility to GDS-implemented extrusion
  - The two adjacent points that are farthest apart are identified.
  - The polygon is reordered so that these two points become the start and end of the sequence.
  - Any duplicate endpoints are removed, ensuring the polygon remains open.
- **TODO: Optimize polygon simplification by adapting the angle threshold dynamically based on polygon complexity.**
- **TODO: Try to remove this altogether by using level-set based processing.**

### **6. Reinserting the Modified Polygons**
- Extracted contours from the rasterized grid are scaled back to the original GDSII coordinate space.
- The new polygons replace the previous elements in the GDS elements of the `GDSGeometry` class.
- The new elements are then passed to the `addPolygon` function instead of the original GDSII polygons.
- Since some original polygons may merge, any unused elements are removed.
- **TODO: Improve the extrusion process which is not robust and can fail with complex geometries and near-closed polygons.**

### **7. Debugging and Visualization**
- When the Logger level is `INFO` or above, the following are generated:
  - Initial GDSII polygons: `GDSII_layerL_polygonN.csv`
  - Exposure grid for e-beam writing: `layerL_exposure.csv`
  - Exposure grid output: `layerL_finalExposure.csv`
  - Extracted contour for a layer: `layerL_allContours.csv`
  - Polygon outputs: `layerL_polygon_N.csv`
  - Simplified polygon outputs: `layerL_simplePolygon_N.csv`
- Python visualization script: `plotCSV.py`

### GDS mask import example

This [example](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS/tree/maskOPC/examples/GDSReader) tests the GDS mask import feature. The difference in the final mask profiles before and after proximity correction are given in the image below.

</div>


### **TODO: Future Work for Level Set-Based Mask Processing**
- **Add option to generate a dense 2D/3D LS directly from SDF values.**
- **Support grid coarsening for computational efficiency.**
  - **Rasterization grid needs to be finer than the final geometry.**
- **Implement level-set-based extrusion**
  - **2D level sets would serve as layers in a 3D level set (stack 2D layers).**
  - **Use contour-generated level set as middle-layers.**
  - **Generate top/bottom capping layers based on distances to the contour in 2D domain.**

The CMake configuration automatically checks if the dependencies are installed.
If the dependencies are not found on the system, they will be built from source. To use local installations of the dependencies, the `VIENNAPS_LOOKUP_DIRS` variable can be set to the installation path of the dependencies.

## Installing

> [!NOTE]  
> __For more detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting tips, please refer to the ViennaPS [documentation](https://viennatools.github.io/ViennaPS/inst/).__

ViennaPS is a header-only library, so no formal installation is required. However, following the steps below helps organize and manage dependencies more effectively:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS.git
cd ViennaPS

cmake -B build && cmake --build build
cmake --install build --prefix "/path/to/your/custom/install/"
```

This will install the necessary headers and CMake files to the specified path. If `--prefix` is not specified, it will be installed to the standard path for your system, usually `/usr/local/` . 

## Building the Python package

The Python package can be built and installed using the `pip` command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS.git
cd ViennaPS

pip install .
```

> Some features of the ViennaPS Python module require the ViennaLS Python module. It is therefore recommended to additionally install the ViennaLS Python module on your system. Instructions to do so can be found in the [ViennaLS Git Repository](https://github.com/ViennaTools/viennals).

## Using the Python package

The 2D version of the library can be imported as follows:
```python
import viennaps2d as vps
```

In order to switch to three dimensions, only the import needs to be changed:

```python
import viennaps3d as vps
```

## Integration in CMake projects

We recommend using [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) to consume this library.

* Installation with CPM
  ```cmake
  CPMAddPackage("gh:viennatools/viennaps@3.4.0")
  ```

* With a local installation
    > In case you have ViennaPS installed in a custom directory, make sure to properly specify the [`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html#envvar:CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH).

    ```cmake
    list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/your/local/installation")

    find_package(ViennaPS)
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ViennaTools::ViennaPS)
    ```

## GPU Acceleration (Experimental)

As of version 3.4.0, ViennaPS supports GPU acceleration for the ray tracing part of the library. This feature is still experimental and may not work on all systems. Details on how to enable GPU functionality can be found in the [documentation](https://viennatools.github.io/ViennaPS/inst/).

## Basic Examples

### Building

The examples can be built using CMake:
> __Important__: Make sure all dependencies are installed and have been built previously

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS.git
cd ViennaPS

cmake -B build -DVIENNAPS_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build
```

The examples can then be executed in their respective build folders with the config files, e.g.:
```bash
cd examples/exampleName
./exampleName.bat config.txt # (Windows)
./exampleName config.txt # (Other)
```

Individual examples can also be build by calling `make` in their respective build folder. An equivalent Python script, using the ViennaPS Python bindings, is also given for each example. 

### Trench Deposition

This [example](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS/tree/master/examples/trenchDeposition) focuses on a particle deposition process within a trench geometry. By default, the simulation presents a 2D representation of the trench. Nevertheless, users have the flexibility to conduct 3D simulations by adjusting the value of the constant _D_ in __trenchDeposition.cpp__ to 3. Customization of process and geometry parameters is achieved through the __config.txt__ file. The accompanying image illustrates instances of the trench deposition process, showcasing variations in the particle sticking probability _s_.

</div>

### SF<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Hole Etching

This [example](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS/tree/master/examples/holeEtching) demonstrates a hole etching process with a SF<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plasma etching chemistry with ion bombardment. The process is controlled by various parameters, including geometry and plasma conditions, which can be adjusted in the __config.txt__ file.

The image presents the results of different flux configurations, as tested in _testFluxes.py_. Each structure represents a variation in flux conditions, leading to differences in hole shape, depth, and profile characteristics. The variations highlight the influence of ion and neutral fluxes on the etching process.

> [!NOTE] 
> The underlying model may change in future releases, so running this example in newer versions of ViennaPS might not always reproduce exactly the same results.  
> The images shown here were generated using **ViennaPS v3.3.0**.

### Bosch Process

This [example](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS/tree/master/examples/boschProcess) compares different approaches to simulating the Bosch process, a deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) technique. The three structures illustrate how different modeling methods influence the predicted etch profile.

- Left: The structure generated through process emulation, which captures the characteristic scalloping effect of the Bosch process in a simplified yet effective way.
- Middle: The result of a simple simulation model, which approximates the etching dynamics but may lack finer physical details.
- Right: The outcome of a more physical simulation model, leading to a more realistic etch profile.
  
This comparison highlights the trade-offs between computational efficiency and physical accuracy in DRIE simulations.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/bosch_process.png" width=700 style="background-color:white;">
</div>


### Anisotropic Processes

In the anisotropic process model, the etch or deposition rates are dependent on the crystallographic directions of the surface. This enables the accurate modeling of intricate processes like [epitaxial growth](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS/tree/master/examples/selectiveEpitaxy) or [anisotropic wet etching](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS/tree/master/examples/cantileverWetEtching). Basic examples, illustrating these processes are provided with the library and shown below.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/anisotropic_process.svg" width=700 style="background-color:white;">
</div>

### Redeposition During Selective Etching

This [example](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaPS/tree/master/examples/oxideRegrowth) demonstrates capturing etching byproducts and the subsequent redeposition during a selective etching process in a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> stack. The etching byproducts are captured in a cell set description of the etching plasma. To model the dynamics of these etching byproducts, a convection-diffusion equation is solved on the cell set using finite differences. The redeposition is then captured by adding up the byproducts in every step and using this information to generate a velocity field on the etched surface.
