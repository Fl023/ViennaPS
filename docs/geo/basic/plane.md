# Plane

---

This class provides a simple way to create a plane in a level set. It can be used to
create a substrate of any material. The plane can be added to an already existing
geometry or a new geometry can be created. The plane is created with normal
direction in the positive z direction in 3D and positive y direction in 2D. The plane
is centered around the origin with the total specified extent and height. The plane
can have a periodic boundary in the x and y (only 3D) direction.
