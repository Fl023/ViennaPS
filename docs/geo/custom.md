# Custom Geometry using ViennaLS
{: .fs-9 .fw-500 }

---

ViennaPS offers the capability to create custom geometries using tools from the ViennaLS library. The [`viennals::MakeGeometry`](https://viennatools.github.io/ViennaLS/classviennals_1_1MakeGeometry.html) function provides functionality for constructing basic geometric shapes like boxes, spheres, or cylinders. Moreover, shapes can be formed by creating a convex hull over a point cloud or by explicitly defining points and elements of a structure.
Subsequently, boolean operations such as union, intersect, and relative complement can be applied to merge these basic shapes into a customized geometry. This flexible approach enables users to create complex geometries tailored to their specific simulation requirements.
Some examples are provided below:
