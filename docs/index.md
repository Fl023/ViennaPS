ViennaPS is a header-only C++ process simulation library, which includes surface and volume representations, a ray tracer, and physical models for the simulation of microelectronic fabrication processes. This library seamlessly integrates advanced level-set functionalities with top-down Monte Carlo flux calculations, powered by state-of-the-art ray tracing techniques. This combination brings a new level of accuracy and efficiency to process simulations, empowering engineers and researchers to model complex systems.
